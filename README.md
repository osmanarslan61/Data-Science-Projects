In this project, we scrape historical flight prices for 60 days from Google Flights Website and use this data to predict best time to purchase flight tickets for future flights.

Data Scraping: We use Selenium to automate the data scraping process. We scrape prices for flights from RDU Airport to 25 different destinations. 
For each flight we scrape historical prices for 60 days until the flight date.
